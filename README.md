##Introduction:

iGrow is a web/mobile application designed for people who like to grow their own plants, it is suitable for beginners who started growing plants and need to watch them and take care of them. In this app the users create their own gardens and add plants to it where they get information about watering, sun exposure, blooming times and more for each type of plant in their garden. Also the user has the option to add a new plant if it wasn't one of the app listed plants, the user can enter all needed data of the new plant and add it to the database and it would be available to all users, this option will provide variety of plants for users to add to their gardens.
This app was created to encourage people for growing plants by themselves, give them an easy solution to take care of their plants and provide suitable circumstances for them to grow.

##Technical Details:

This app was built using the MEAN stack (MongoDB , Express.js, Angular.js and Node.js). It has options for users to create an account, browse plants, create their own gardens and add or remove plants from their gardens.

##Future Work:
There are different ideas to modify and add for this app like adding options for users to connect with each other (forum) to share images of their gardens, experiences and recommendations. Also, adding an option to show nearby stores where users can find the plants they are looking for. Currently the app is designed to be a web app but in future it can be designed to work as mobile app.
